# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This repository contains examples and exercises related to lists and tuples in Python. The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive introduction to these data structures and their applications in Python programming.

## Lists

Lists are one of the most fundamental data structures in Python, and are used to store collections of items. Lists are ordered and changeable, and can contain items of different data types. They are defined using square brackets, and items are separated by commas.

## python

```bash
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

In this repository, you will find examples and exercises on the following topics related to lists:

    Creating and accessing lists
    Modifying lists
    Sorting lists
    List comprehensions
    Nested lists

## Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists in many ways, but they have some key differences. Tuples are ordered and unchangeable, and they can also contain items of different data types. They are defined using parentheses, and items are separated by commas.

```python

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```
In this repository, you will find examples and exercises on the following topics related to tuples:

    Creating and accessing tuples
    Modifying tuples
    Sorting tuples
    Unpacking tuples

## Prerequisites

This repository assumes a basic knowledge of Python programming. Before diving into the examples and exercises, it is recommended that you have a good understanding of the following concepts:

    Variables
    Data types (strings, integers, etc.)
    Loops
    Conditional statements
